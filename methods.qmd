The analysis focused on the Northeast United States (PA, NJ, NY, CT, RI, MA, NH, VT, ME).

## Analytical Approach

1.  **Geospatial Processing:** We aggregated high-resolution noise raster data to the county level using population-weighted zonal statistics.
2.  **Statistical Modeling:** We employed Ridge Regression and Random Forest models to isolate the effect of noise on health outcomes while controlling for socioeconomic confounders.
