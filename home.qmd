## Project Overview

Does the roar of a highway or the rumble of a train affect your physical and mental health? This project investigates the relationship between **transportation noise pollution** and various health outcomes across counties in the Northeast United States.

By integrating National Transportation Noise Map data with CDC PLACES health data and US Census socioeconomic indicators, we aim to uncover statistical links between our acoustic environment and our well-being.

## Key Findings at a Glance

:::::: grid
::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
### The "Expectation of Quiet"

Psychological sensitivity to noise is linked to privilege. High-income/education groups report the **highest depression** rates (~24%) despite living in the quietest areas, suggesting a lower tolerance for environmental disturbance.

### The "Cosmopolitan Buffer"

A striking paradox exists in dense urban cores: residents report the **lowest depression** (~15%) yet suffer the **highest cholesterol** (~36%). The social vibrancy of the city protects the mind, but the noise silently taxes the body.

### The Hidden "Body Tax"

While lower-income groups report less psychological distress (likely due to habituation), their bodies keep the score. We observed a classic **Environmental Justice** pattern where noise exposure correlates strongly with high cholesterol (Allostatic Load) in lower-education populations.
