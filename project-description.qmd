## Motivation

Noise pollution is often an overlooked environmental stressor. While air pollution's effects are well-documented, the chronic stress caused by transportation noise, from road, rail, and aviation, may have significant impacts on cardiovascular and mental health.

## Data Sources

Three primary datasets were utilized for this analysis:

1.  **National Transportation Noise Map (2020):**
    * *Source:* US Department of Transportation.
    * *Format:* Raster data (.tif/vrt).
    * *Metric:* 24-hour equivalent sound level (LAeq24).

2.  **CDC PLACES Data (2023):**
    * *Source:* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    * *Format:* API / GeoJSON.
    * *Metrics:* County-level prevalence of 18 health outcomes (e.g., Depression, Stroke, Asthma).

3.  **US Census ACS (2021):**
    * *Source:* American Community Survey (5-Year Estimates).
    * *Metrics:* Poverty rates, median income, racial demographics, and education levels (used as control variables).
