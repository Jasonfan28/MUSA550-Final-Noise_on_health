    "text": "Key Findings at a Glance\n\n\nThe “Expectation of Quiet”\nPsychological sensitivity to noise is linked to privilege. High-income/education groups report the highest depression rates (~24%) despite living in the quietest areas, suggesting a lower tolerance for environmental disturbance.\n\n\nThe “Cosmopolitan Buffer”\nA striking paradox exists in dense urban cores: residents report the lowest depression (~15%) yet suffer the highest cholesterol (~36%). The social vibrancy of the city protects the mind, but the noise silently taxes the body.\n\n\nThe Hidden “Body Tax”\nWhile lower-income groups report less psychological distress (likely due to habituation), their bodies keep the score. We observed a classic Environmental Justice pattern where noise exposure correlates strongly with high cholesterol (Allostatic Load) in lower-education populations."

    "text": "Findings: The Divergence Between Perceived and Physiological Stress\n\nThe “Expectation of Quiet” vs. Biological Reality\nThe most critical insight from this study is that environmental quality does not impact mental and physical health in lockstep. Instead, we found a sharp disconnect between how different populations feel about noise and how their bodies physically react to it.\nPsychologically, the data supports an “Expectation of Quiet.” It is actually the wealthiest and most educated residents who show the steepest rise in depression as noise levels increase. This suggests that for privileged groups, noise is a violation of their environmental standards, leading to acute annoyance and reported distress. Conversely, lower-income groups appear to habituate to the noise, reporting lower depression levels likely because environmental sound is deprioritized amidst more immediate survival stressors.\nHowever, the physiological markers tell a different, more concerning story. Following a classic Environmental Justice pattern, lower-education populations show a strong correlation between noise exposure and high cholesterol. Even if they do not report feeling “stressed” or depressed, their bodies are absorbing the wear and tear of the environment—a phenomenon known as allostatic load.\n\n\nThe “Cosmopolitan Buffer” and Hidden Costs\nThis paradox becomes even clearer when we look at specific neighborhood archetypes. The most striking contradiction is found in Cluster 2 (“The Cosmopolitan Core”)—dense, diverse, and noisy urban centers populated by high-income residents.\nResidents here benefit from a “Cosmopolitan Buffer.” They report the lowest rates of depression (~15%), suggesting that they psychologically offset the annoyance of noise with the social and economic vibrancy of city life. But this resilience comes with a hidden receipt: this same group suffers from the highest prevalence of high cholesterol (~36%). While the amenities of the city protect their mood, the high-stimulation environment is exacting a silent physiological tax.\n\n\nThe Burden of the Periphery\nOn the other end of the spectrum is Cluster 3 (“The Quiet Elite”). These residents enjoy the lowest noise levels and best physical health (lowest cholesterol), yet they report the highest rates of depression (~24%). This reinforces the idea that sensitivity to noise is a byproduct of privilege; without the distraction of urban life, and perhaps isolated by suburban design, these residents are hyper-aware of environmental disturbances.\nUltimately, the heaviest cost falls on Cluster 0 (“The Vulnerable Periphery”). Comprising lower-income, older populations in high-noise areas, this group lacks both the “amenity buffer” of the city center and the “protective wealth” of the elite suburbs. Consequently, they experience moderately high levels of both depression and physiological stress, confirming that the most vulnerable populations lack the resources to decouple their health from their environment.\n\n\n\nnoise map"

    "text": "2. Data Gathering\n\nProcessing Noise Raster Data\nThe National Transportation Noise Map is provided as individual high-resolution TIFF files for each state. To analyze the Northeast as a contiguous region, I needed to merge these into a single mosaic.\nBecause the uncompressed raster data exceeds 50GB, merging them into a physical file is inefficient and computationally expensive. Instead, I utilized GDAL to build a Virtual Raster (VRT). A VRT acts as a pointer file that treats the collection of state rasters as a single seamless map without duplicating the underlying data.\n\n\nData Ingestion Pipeline\nTo streamline the process, I created a DataPipeline class. This class handles the connection to the CDC API, downloads county boundaries, and manages the noise raster file paths.\n\n\nUtility Functions\nWe also defined helper functions for multicollinearity checks (VIF) and correlation plotting.\n\n\nLoading the Data\nNote: Since API calls and spatial joins are computationally expensive, the code below demonstrates the logic used. For this website report, we load the pre-processed GeoJSON files directly.\n\n\nFetching Census Socioeconomic Data\nWe target the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates for this analysis. The 5-year estimates are preferred over 1-year data for this project because they provide higher statistical precision for areas with smaller populations, smoothing out annual volatility in rural counties. We specifically query variables that serve as robust proxies for Social Determinants of Health (SDOH):\n\nEconomic Stability: Median_Income and Poverty_Count are variables which measure community wealth and economic deprivation. Low-income communities often face higher exposure to environmental stressors and have fewer resources to mitigate them (e.g., soundproofing, healthcare access).\nEnvironmental Justice: White_Count, Asian_Count,Hispanic_Count, and Black_Count are included to test for potential disparities in noise exposure. Environmental justice literature suggests that transportation infrastructure is disproportionately sited near communities of color. Senior_Count also looks at if older adults are more impacted by noise and health outcomes.\nEducation: Bachelor_Degree_Count is included as educational attainment is a strong predictor of health literacy and overall socioeconomic status, often providing explanatory power beyond income alone."

Therefore I got rid of features until it wasn’t bad\n While Log_income has a VIF above 5, I’ll be getting rid of something that might be correlated to the income such as poverty. This is due to income showing a lot more about a place such as being wealthy or not, while poverty only shows one statistic.\n Now all VIF is below 5 showing no multicollinearity, meaning that each variables are completely independent of each other.\n\n\nP Value Test\nFound very little significance, with p-values all being high, and a large amount of multicollinearity. Therefore, I started to look for potential interaction terms. The assumption for these results is due to socioeconomic variables having too much correlation.\n\n\n\ninteraction model\n\n\n\nInital Assumption:\nNoise pollution is an equity issue. It disproportionately impacts mental health in lower-income communities, while wealthier residents are buffered from its effects.\nWealthy/High-Degree Areas: The noise doesn’t bother them as much. Maybe they have better soundproofing, better windows, or the noise is “positive” noise (bustling cafes) rather than “negative” noise (highways/industrial).\nLower-Degree Areas: The relationship between Noise and Depression is stronger. Here, noise acts as a stressor that compounds with financial stress.\n\n\n\nLooking for other interactions using this model\nCreated a new predictor that is ‘avg_noise_db’ * ‘Pct_Degree’ to represent more than just the people with no degree like before.\n \nDepression along with High Cholesterol appeared to have significant interactions.\n\n\nPlotting\n #### Impact of noise on depression accounting for education level: * Relative Deprivation: Higher socioeconomic standard individuals may feel more “entitled” to quiet environments. When that expectation is violated, the psychological toll (annoyance, frustration, depression) is higher.\n\nAwareness vs. Survival: Lower socioeconomic standard populations often face a “hierarchy of needs” where immediate stressors (financial instability, food security, crime) outweigh environmental noise. They may “tune out” the noise psychologically because it is just one of many stressors, resulting in lower reported noise-related depression, even if the noise is high.\n\n #### Impact of noise on cholesterol accounting for education level: * The Body Keeps the Score: Even if lower-education populations do not report higher depression, their bodies are biologically reacting to the noise stressor. The noise is triggering cortisol production and raising cholesterol, regardless of their conscious “acceptance” of the noise.\n\nProtective Factors for High SES: The highly educated group might be annoyed by the noise, but they have the resources to mitigate the physical damage (better diet, healthcare access, better sound-insulation in homes), keeping their cholesterol levels decoupled from the noise levels.\n\n\n\nCluster Analysis\nConducted cluster analysis to see the spatial split of how these factors impact specific communities.\n While the drop is great between cluster 1 and 2, it greatly decreases between 2 and 3 and 4. Too vague to fully tell which one to use\n While k=2 is the highest silhouette score, having only 2 clusters isn’t going to be helpful.\nTherefore, I will be using k=4 as the second highest score\n Cluster 0: Highest noise, lowest income/education. oldest pop, and white (low income, old, white pop with high noise)\nCluster 1: average across the board (middle ground)\nCluster 2: Highest income, high education, relatively high noise, very diverse, and pop density (major urban center with wealthy educated and diverse people, still high noise)\nCluster 3: Lowest noice, highest education (Wealthy highly educated suburbs with little noise stress)\n\nBoxplot\n \nCluster 2: low depression and high cholestrol. (wealthy, diverse, and living in high density and high noise environments. They don’t report feeling depressed but they have the highest cholesterol showing worst physiological stress indicators.)\nCluster 3: low cholestrol but high depression (has the quiet but bad mental health. Could be that they are accustomed to quiet environments, that they have a lower threshold for noise causing them distress.)\nCluster 0: low income, older, and high noise exposer. They get hit with everythihng\n\n\n\nmap\n\n\nBased on the box plots and spatial analysis, these findings reveal a striking “Paradox of Place” where psychological well-being and physiological health are inversely related across neighborhood types.\nCluster 2 (The Cosmopolitan Core) presents the most compelling contradiction: residents here report the lowest rates of depression (~15%) yet suffer from the highest rates of high cholesterol (~36%). This suggests a “Cosmopolitan Buffer,” where the economic opportunities, social vibrancy, and amenities of dense urban living protect mental health, causing residents to psychologically “discount” the environmental stressors. However, their bodies still keep the score—the high noise and density create a hidden physiological tax (allostatic load) that manifests as high cholesterol, even if they don’t feel “stressed.”\nConversely, Cluster 3 (The Quiet Elite) shows the exact opposite pattern: they have the lowest cholesterol (indicating good physical health and protective resources) but the highest reported depression (~24%). This supports the “Expectation of Quiet” hypothesis; residents in these privileged, lower-noise areas may be more sensitive to environmental disturbances or suffer from suburban isolation, leading to higher reported mental distress despite their physical safety. Meanwhile, Cluster 0 (The Vulnerable Periphery) lacks the protective buffers of either group, showing moderately high levels of both depression and cholesterol, reflecting the compounding burdens of lower socioeconomic status and environmental exposure."

In a rural county context, this might be capturing the fact that populations are clustered tightly around highways/truck routes in valleys, or it might suggest that \"quiet\" wilderness doesn't offset the noise where people actually live.\n\nCluster 2 (New England) High Seniors (21.8%): This is your oldest cluster. Northern New England (VT/NH/ME) has some of the oldest median ages in the US.\nHigh Depression: Like Cluster 0, this group struggles with mental health. The combination of aging populations and potentially seasonal isolation (long winters in VT/NH/ME) could be a factor here distinct from the economic distress of Cluster 0.\nCluster 1 & 3 (I 95) The “Protected” Class (Cluster 3): This group (Pop 1M+, High Income) likely represents the wealthy suburban counties (e.g., Westchester, Montgomery, Fairfax). Their wealth insulates them from the depression prevalence seen in the rural areas.\nThe Diverse Hubs (Cluster 1): With high Hispanic (19%) and Black (13%) populations, these are likely the diverse, urbanized counties that are economically active but have mixed outcomes."
